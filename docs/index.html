method shortcuts for creating instances of Davis.Routes<br />with the corresponding method.  This allows simple REST styled routing for a client side<br />JavaScript application.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre><code>app.get('/foo/:id', function (req) {\n  // get the foo with id = req.params['id']\n})\n\napp.post('/foo', function (req) {\n  // create a new instance of foo with req.params\n})\n\napp.put('/foo/:id', function (req) {\n  // update the instance of foo with id = req.params['id']\n})\n\napp.del('/foo/:id', function (req) {\n  // delete the instance of foo with id = req.params['id']\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As well as providing convinience methods for creating instances of Davis.Routes the router<br />also provides methods for creating special instances of routes called filters.

Also included is support for rails style nested form params.</p>\n\n<p>By default the request method will be taken from the method attribute for forms or will be defaulted to 'get' for links, however there is support for using a hidden field called _method in your forms to set the correct reqeust method.</p>\n\n<p>Simple get requests can be created by just passing a path when initializing a request, to set the method or title you have to pass in an object.</p>\n\n<p>Each request will have a timestamp property to make it easier to determine if the application is moving forward or backward through the history stack.</p>\n\n<p>Example</p>\n\n<pre><code>var request = new Davis.Request (\"/foo/12\")\n\nvar request = new Davis.Request (\"/foo/12\", {title: 'foo', method: 'POST'})\n\nvar request = new Davis.Request({\n  title: \"foo\",\n  fullPath: \"/foo/12\",\n  method: \"get\"\n})\n</code></pre>","code":"var Request = function (fullPath, opts) {\n    if (typeof fullPath == 'object') {\n      opts = fullPath\n      fullPath = opts.fullPath\n      delete opts.fullPath\n    }\n\n    var raw = Davis.$.extend({}, {\n      title: \"\",\n      fullPath: fullPath,\n      method: \"get\",\n      timestamp: +new Date ()\n    }, opts)\n\n    raw.fullPath = raw.fullPath.replace(/\\+/g, '%20')\n\n    var self = this;\n    this.raw = raw;\n    this.params = {};\n    this.title = raw.title;\n    this.queryString = raw.fullPath.split(\"?\")[1];\n    this.timestamp = raw.timestamp;\n    this._staleCallback = function () {};\n\n    if (this.queryString) {\n      Davis.utils.forEach(this.queryString.split(\"&\"), function (keyval) {\n        var paramName = keyval.split(\"=\")[0],\n            paramValue = keyval.split(\"=\")[1],\n            nestedParamRegex = /^(\\w+)\\[(\\w+)?\\](\\[\\])?/,\n            nested;\n        if (nested = nestedParamRegex.exec(paramName)) {\n          var paramParent = nested[1];\n          var paramName = nested[2];\n          var isArray = !!nested[3];\n          var parentParams = self.params[paramParent] || {};\n\n          if (isArray) {\n            parentParams[paramName] = parentParams[paramName] || [];\n            parentParams[paramName].push(decodeURIComponent(paramValue));\n            self.params[paramParent] = parentParams;\n          } else if (!paramName && !isArray) {\n            parentParams = self.params[paramParent] || []\n            parentParams.push(decodeURIComponent(paramValue))\n            self.params[paramParent] = parentParams\n          } else {\n            parentParams[paramName] = decodeURIComponent(paramValue);\n            self.params[paramParent] = parentParams;\n          }\n        } else {\n          self.params[paramName] = decodeURIComponent(paramValue);\n        };\n\n      });\n    };\n\n    raw.fullPath = raw.fullPath.replace(/^https?:\\/\\/.+?\\//, '/');\n\n    this.method = (this.params._method || raw.method).toLowerCase();\n\n    this.path = raw.fullPath\n      .replace(/\\?(.|[\\r\\n])+$/, \"\")  // Remove the query string\n      .replace(/^https?:\\/\\/[^\\/]+/, \"\"); // Remove the protocol and host parts\n  \n    this.fullPath = raw.fullPath;\n\n    this.delegateToServer = raw.delegateToServer || Davis.noop;\n    this.isForPageLoad = raw.forPageLoad || false;\n\n    if (Request.prev) Request.prev.makeStale(this);\n    Request.prev = this;\n\n  };","params":[{"type":"param","types":["String"],"name":"fullPath","description":""},{"type":"param","types":["Object"],"name":"opts","description":"An optional object with a title or method proprty"}],"has_params":true,"tags":[{"type":"constructor","string":""},{"type":"param","types":["String"],"name":"fullPath","description":""},{"type":"param","types":["Object"],"name":"opts","description":"An optional object with a title or method proprty"}],"module":true,"related":{"href":""},"has_related":true,"methods":[{"id":"45-1362053968978","name":"redirect","signiture":"Request.prototype.redirect()","type":"method","ctx":{"type":"method","constructor":"Request","cons":"Request","name":"redirect","string":"Request.prototype.redirect()"},"description":{"full":"<p>Redirects the current request to a new location.</p>\n\n<p>Calling redirect on an instance of Davis.Request will create a new request using the path and<br />title of the current request.

          <section>
            <p>Davis.Routes are the main part of a Davis application.  They consist of an HTTP method, a path and a callback function.  When a link or a form that Davis has bound to are clicked or submitted a request is pushed on the history stack and a route that matches the path and method of the generated request is run.</p>

<p>The path for the route can consist of placeholders for attributes, these will then be available on the request.  Simple variables should be prefixed with a colan, and for splat style params use an asterisk.</p>

<p>Inside the callback function 'this' is bound to the request.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>var route = new Davis.Route ('get', '/foo/:id', function (req) {
  var id = req.params['id']
  // do something interesting!
})

var route = new Davis.Route ('get', '/foo/*splat', function (req) {
  var id = req.params['splat']
  // splat will contain everything after the /foo/ in the path.
})
</code></pre>

<p>You can include any number of route level 'middleware' when defining routes.  These middlewares are run in order and need to explicitly call the next handler in the stack.  Using route middleware allows you to share common logic between routes and is also a good place to load any data or do any async calls keeping your main handler simple and focused.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>var loadUser = function (req, next) {
  $.get('/users/current', function (user) {
    req.user = user
    next(req)
  })
}

var route = new Davis.Route ('get', '/foo/:id', loadUser, function (req) {
  renderUser(req.user)
})

          <section>
            <p>A decorator that adds convinience methods to a Davis.App for easily creating instances of Davis.Route and looking up routes for a particular request.</p>

<p>Provides get, post put and delete method shortcuts for creating instances of Davis.Routes with the corresponding method.  This allows simple REST styled routing for a client side JavaScript application.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre><code>app.get('/foo/:id', function (req) {
  // get the foo with id = req.params['id']
})

app.post('/foo', function (req) {
  // create a new instance of foo with req.params
})

app.put('/foo/:id', function (req) {
  // update the instance of foo with id = req.params['id']
})

app.del('/foo/:id', function (req) {
  // delete the instance of foo with id = req.params['id']
})
</code></pre>

<p>As well as providing convinience methods for creating instances of Davis.Routes the router also provides methods for creating special instances of routes called filters.  Before filters run before any matching route is run, and after filters run after any matched route has run. A before filter can return false to halt the running of any matched routes or other before filters.</p>

<p>A filter can take an optional path to match on, or without a path will match every request.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre><code>app.before('/foo/:id', function (req) {
  // will only run before request matching '/foo/:id'
})

app.before(function (req) {
  // will run before all routes
})

app.after('/foo/:id', function (req) {
  // will only run after routes matching '/foo/:id'
})

app.after(function (req) {
  // will run after all routes
})
</code></pre>

<p>Another special kind of route, called state routes, are also generated using the router.  State routes are for requests that will not change the current page location.  Instead the page location will remain the same but the current state of the page has changed.  This allows for states which the server will not be expected to know about and support.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre><code>app.state('/foo/:id', function (req) {
  // will run when the app transitions into the '/foo/:id' state.
})
</code></pre>

<p>Using the <code>trans</code> method an app can transition to these kind of states without changing the url location.</p>

<p>For convinience routes can be defined within a common base scope, this is useful for keeping your route definitions simpler and DRYer.  A scope can either cover the whole app, or just a subset of the routes.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre><code>app.scope('/foo', function () {
  this.get('/:id', function () {
    // will run for routes that match '/foo/:id'
  })
})
</code></pre>

                <p>Low level method for adding routes to your application.</p>

<p>If called with just a method will return a partially applied function that can create routes with that method.  This is used internally to provide shortcuts for get, post, put, delete and state routes.</p>

<p>You normally want to use the higher level methods such as get and post, but this can be useful for extending Davis to work with other kinds of requests.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>app.route('get', '/foo', function (req) {
  // will run when a get request is made to '/foo'
})

app.patch = app.route('patch') // will return a function that can be used to handle requests with method of patch.
app.patch('/bar', function (req) {
  // will run when a patch request is made to '/bar'
})

                <p>Modifies the scope of the router.</p>

<p>If you have many routes that share a common path prefix you can use scope to reduce repeating that path prefix.</p>

<p>You can use <code>scope</code> in two ways, firstly you can set the scope for the whole app by calling scope before defining routes.  You can also provide a function to the scope method, and the scope will only apply to those routes defined within this function. It is  also possible to nest scopes within other scopes.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre><code>// using scope with a function
app.scope('/foo', function () {
  this.get('/bar', function (req) {
    // this route will have a path of '/foo/bar'
  })
})

// setting a global scope for the rest of the application
app.scope('/bar')

// using scope with a function
app.scope('/foo', function () {
  this.scope('/bar', function () {
    this.get('/baz', function (req) {
      // this route will have a path of '/foo/bar/baz'
    })
  })
})
</code></pre>

              <section>
                <p>Transitions the app into the state identified by the passed path parameter.</p>

<p>This allows the app to enter states without changing the page path through a link click or form submit.  If there are handlers registered for this state, added by the <code>state</code> method, they will be triggered.</p>

<p>This method generates a request with a method of 'state', in all other ways this request is identical to those that are generated when clicking links etc.</p>

<p>States transitioned to using this method will not be able to be revisited directly with a page load as there is no url that represents the state.</p>

<p>An optional second parameter can be passed which will be available to any handlers in the requests params object.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre><code>app.trans('/foo/1')

app.trans('/foo/1', {
  "bar": "baz"
})
</code></pre>

            <p>A module that acts as a delegator to any locationDelegate implementation.  This abstracts the details of what is being used for the apps routing away from the rest of the library.  This allows any kind of routing To be used with Davis as long as it can respond appropriatly to the given delegate methods.</p>

<p>A routing module must respond to the following methods</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>current</strong> : Should return the current location for the app</li>
<li><strong>assign</strong> : Should set the current location of the app based on the location of the passed request.</li>
<li><strong>replace</strong> : Should at least change the current location to the location of the passed request, for full compatibility it should not add any extra items in the history stack.</li>
<li><strong>onChange</strong> : Should add calbacks that will be fired whenever the location is changed.</li>

          <section>
            <p>Davis.Requests are created from click and submit events.  Davis.Requests are passed to Davis.Routes and are stored in the history stack.  They are instantiated by the Davis.listener module.</p>

<p>A request will have a params object which will contain all query params and form params, any named params in a routes path will also be added to the requests params object.  Also included is support for rails style nested form params.</p>

<p>By default the request method will be taken from the method attribute for forms or will be defaulted to 'get' for links, however there is support for using a hidden field called _method in your forms to set the correct reqeust method.</p>

<p>Simple get requests can be created by just passing a path when initializing a request, to set the method or title you have to pass in an object.</p>

<p>Each request will have a timestamp property to make it easier to determine if the application is moving forward or backward through the history stack.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre><code>var request = new Davis.Request ("/foo/12")

var request = new Davis.Request ("/foo/12", {title: 'foo', method: 'POST'})

var request = new Davis.Request({
  title: "foo",
  fullPath: "/foo/12",
  method: "get"
})

                <p>Redirects the current request to a new location.</p>

<p>Calling redirect on an instance of Davis.Request will create a new request using the path and title of the current request. Redirected requests always have a method of 'get'.</p>

<p>The request created will replace the current request in the history stack.  Redirect is most often useful inside a handler for a form submit.  After succesfully handling the form the app can redirect to another path.  This means that the current form will not be re-submitted if navigating through the history with the back or forward buttons because the request that the submit generated has been replaced in the history stack.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre><code>this.post('/foo', function (req) {
  processFormRequest(req.params)  // do something with the form request
  req.redirect('/bar');
})
</code></pre>

                <p>Adds a callback to be called when the request is stale. A request becomes stale when it is no longer the current request, this normally occurs when a new request is triggered.  A request can be marked as stale manually if required.  The callback passed to whenStale will be called with the new request that is making the current request stale.</p>

<p>Use the whenStale callback to 'teardown' the objects required for the current route, this gives a chance for views to hide themselves and unbind any event handlers etc.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre><code>this.get('/foo', function (req) {
  var fooView = new FooView ()
  fooView.render() // display the foo view
  req.whenStale(function (nextReq) {
    fooView.remove() // stop displaying foo view and unbind any events
  })
})

<p><code>linkSelector</code> is the jquery selector for all the links on the page that you want Davis to respond to.  These links will not trigger a normal http request.</p>

<p><code>formSelector</code> is similar to link selector but for all the forms that davis will bind to</p>

<p><code>throwErrors</code> decides whether or not any errors will be caugth by Davis.  If this is set to true errors will be thrown so that the request will not be handled by JavaScript, the server will have to provide a response.  When set to false errors in a route will be caught and the server will not receive the request.</p>

<p><code>handleRouteNotFound</code> determines whether or not Davis should handle requests when there is no matching route.  If set to false Davis will allow the request to be passed to your server to handle if no matching route can be found.</p>

<p><code>generateRequestOnPageLoad</code> determines whether a request should be generated for the initial page load. by default this is set to false. A Davis.Request will not be generated with the path of the current page.  Setting this to true will cause a request to be passed to your app for the inital page load.</p>
