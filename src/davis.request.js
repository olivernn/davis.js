/**
 * Daivs.Requests are created from click and submit events.  Davis.Requests are passed to Davis.Routes
 * and are stored in the history stack.  They are instantiated by the Davis.listener module.
 *
 * A request will have a params object which will contain all query params and form params, any named
 * params in a routes path will also be added to the requests params object.  Also included is support
 * for rails style nested form params.
 *
 * By default the request method will be taken from the method attribute for forms or will be defaulted
 * to 'get' for links, however there is support for using a hidden field called _method in your forms
 * to set the correct reqeust method.
 *
 * @constructor
 * @param {Object} raw An object that at least contains a title, fullPath and method proprty.
 *
 * ### Example:
 *     var request = new Davis.Request({
 *       title: "foo",
 *       fullPath: "/foo/12",
 *       method: "get"
 *     })

/**
 * ## request.redirect
 * Redirects the current request to a new location.  Calling redirect on an instance of
 * Davis.Request will create a new request using the path and title of the current request.
 * Redirected requests always have a method of 'get'
 *
 * The request created will replace the current request in the history stack.  Redirect is most
 * often useful inside a handler for a form submit.  After succesfully handling the form the app
 * can redirect to another path.  This means that the current form will not be re-submitted if
 * navigating through the history with the back or forward buttons because the request that the
 * submit generated has been replaced in the history stack.
 *
 * @param {String} path The path to redirect the current request to
 *
 * ### Example:
 *     this.post('/foo', function (req) {
 *       processFormRequest(req.params)  // do something with the form request
 *       req.redirect('/bar');
 *     })

/**
 * ## request.whenStale
 * Adds a callback to be called when the request is stale.  A request becomes stale when it is no
 * longer the current request, this normally occurs when a new request is triggered.  A request 
 * can be marked as stale manually if required.  The callback passed to whenStale will be called
 * with the new request that is making the current request stale.
 *
 * Use the whenStale callback to 'teardown' the objects required for the current route, this gives
 * a chance for views to hide themselves and unbind any event handlers etc.
 *
 * @param {Function} callback A single callback that will be called when the request becomes stale.
 *
 * ### Example:
 *     this.get('/foo', function (req) {
 *       var fooView = new FooView ()
 *       fooView.render() // display the foo view
 *       req.whenStale(function (nextReq) {
 *         fooView.remove() // stop displaying foo view and unbind any events
 *       })
 *     })
